question1: From a given file, compute mean, median, STD, min and max of a certain column, print to user
question2: From given file, make a histogram and boxplot of a certain column of data, display to user
question3: Build training and testing set of numerical data from a file
question4: Compute KNN model at k-5 for trained/tested data set, read from a file. Display accuracy, precision, confusion matrix, recall, f1 score. Display to user.
question5: Compare accurace score of KNN model at k values where k=[1,3,5,7,9]. 

*Note: For kidney_disease dataset, I cleaned all the data in numerical columns by replaceing missing values with the mean value of the column.
I also changed the column "Classification" to binary where 1=ckd and 0=notckd
